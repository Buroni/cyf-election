<p>Clone this repo using the command</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/Buroni/cyf-election.git</code></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>After a recent referendum, London has gained independence from the rest of the UK. 
A snap election will be held in a month to decide who will be the leader of the new country.
You have been asked to implement an electronic voting system in javascript which allows the 
government to easily register voters into the system, filter out invalid votes and calculate who
the winning candidate is.</p>
<p>The three files you will be working on during this project are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>election.js</code> - Contains all of the functions required to carry out the election process. From part 2
onwards this file will be modularised into classes.</li>
<li><code>index.html</code> - Displays the election results. From part 2 onwards this file will also take user input.</li>
<li><code>voters.json</code> - The &quot;real&quot; voter data. This file will not appear until the election occurs at part 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to make the project more manageable, it has been broken down into three parts. They are outlined below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1: write the functions required to carry out the election process, and allow the results
with a small amount of sample data to be displayed on a HTML page.</li>
<li>Part 2: re-organise the functions into three classes: <code>Voter</code>, <code>Candidate</code> and <code>Election</code>, and improve
the voter validation process. Allow new voters to be inputted via a HTML page.</li>
<li>Part 3 (election time): run the election on a large population stored as a JSON file.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="voter-data-format">Voter Data Format</h3>
<p>Have a look at the sample voter data provided in
<code>election.js</code>. You will notice that the voters are stored as an array of objects,
and that their voting card is an array of integers. Each integer in the <code>votingCard</code> array represents a
candidate id where each ID has double the weight of the ID on its right. </p>
<p>So for example, if my <code>votingCard</code> array is <code>[1,3,2]</code> I cast 1 vote for candidate 1, I cast 0.5 votes for 
candidate 3 and 0.025 votes for candidate 2.</p>
<h3 id="candidate-data-format">Candidate Data Format</h3>
<p>Now look at the sample candidate data. Like the voter data, each candidate is stored as an object
but with some different properties. You should also notice that unlike the voter data which is stored as
an <em>array of objects</em>, the candidate data is stored as an <em>object containing objects</em>. Each object
key represents the ID of the candidate. For example the candidate <em>Tamara Faiza</em> has candidate ID 1.</p>
<p>The <code>numVotes</code> property in each candidate object represents the number of votes that candidate received in the election.
When a new instance of a candidate is created, their <code>numVotes</code> property should always be 0.</p>
<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>
<h3 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h3>
<p>Candidates should also be able to vote in the election, however right now the format of <code>candidates</code> isn&apos;t such 
that we can just concatenate it onto the <code>votingPopulation</code> array. </p>
<p>Write a function <code>candidatesObjToArray</code> which takes
the <code>candidates</code> object as input, and returns an array of candidates which can be joined onto <code>votingPopulation</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hint: You might find the <code>map</code> function useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h3>
<p>Before we worry about how to calculate the election results, we need to introduce some
definition of an invalid voting card. Right now we regard a voting card as invalid if it
contains more than two votes, or contains multiple votes for the same candidate.</p>
<p>Write a function <code>filterInvalidVoters</code> which
removes any voters who have voted for more than 2 people, or have voted for the same person twice.
This function should input the <code>allVoters</code> array, and return an array containing only valid voters.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h3>
<p>Right now all candidates have <code>numVotes</code> set to 0. Write a function <code>runElection</code> which takes the <code>votingPopulation</code> and
<code>candidates</code> as arguments. The function should change the <code>numVotes</code> property of each candidate based on the voting cards
of the voters, and return a candidates object with each candidate having an updated <code>numVotes</code> value.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-4">Exercise 4</h3>
<p>Write a function <code>getWinner</code> which taken the updated candidates object as input, and returns the candidate with the most votes if there is no draw. If there
is a draw, the function should return <code>null</code>.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-5">Exercise 5</h3>
<p>Write a function <code>printWinnerMessage</code> whose input is the winner previously calculated by <code>getWinner</code>. This function should print &quot;The election was a draw&quot; if a draw occurred,
otherwise it should print a message including the winner&apos;s name and how many votes he/she received.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-6">Exercise 6</h3>
<p>You have permission from the government to change people&apos;s voting cards
because the real election hasn&apos;t occurred yet.</p>
<p>If the previous 5 exercises were completed correctly, you should see a message saying that <em>Tamara Faiza</em> has won the election with 3.5 votes. Change 
<em>Nour al-Din</em>&apos;s voting card from <code>[4,1]</code> to <code>[4,3]</code> and you should notice that a draw has occurred. </p>
